nvPY installation guide
=======================

There are many (mostly very easy) ways to install nvPY. This document summarises a number of them.

Windows step-by-step for beginners
==================================

Following this recipe, you'll first install Python for win32 (this also works on Windows 64!), then Python setuptools and pip, and then nvpy itself.

1. Download and install (by double-clicking) the Python 2.7.3 Windows Installer: http://python.org/ftp/python/2.7.3/python-2.7.3.msi
2. Download and install (by double-clicking) Python setuptools: http://pypi.python.org/packages/2.7/s/setuptools/setuptools-0.6c11.win32-py2.7.exe
3. Start a command shell by pressing Windows-R and typing "cmd" followed by enter into the input box that appears.
4. At the command shell prompt, type the following::

    \Python27\Scripts\easy_install pip
    \Python27\Scripts\pip install nvpy

5. In c:\\users\\yourlogin\\ (this is your user directory on Windows) create a file called nvpy.cfg, using your favourite text editor, with the lines::

    [nvpy]
    sn_username = your_simplenote_email
    sn_password = your_simplenote_password

   If you're not sure how to do this, just type the following at the command shell prompt::

    notepad %HOMEPATH%\nvpy.cfg

   Then copy and paste the three lines above starting with [nvpy] into the editor window that appears, replace your_simplenote_email and your_simplenote_password with your simplenote login details, then select Save from the File menu.

6. From now on, start nvpy by double-clicking on "nvpy.exe" in c:\\Python27\\Scripts\\ -- consider creating a shortcut to this on your desktop or in your start menu.

For curious users: The magic invocation in step 4 automatically downloads and installs both pip and nvpy. We could have skipped the pip installation, installing nvpy directly with easy_install, but having pip around is useful in the future.

To upgrade an existing installation of nvpy, do the following::

    pip uninstall nvpy
    pip install --upgrade --ignore-installed --no-deps nvpy


Ubuntu / Mint / Debian step-by-step #1
======================================

On Debian-flavoured systems with apt, this generally works::

    sudo apt-get install python python-tk python-pip python-markdown
    sudo pip install nvpy

Create a file in your home directory called .nvpy.cfg with just the following contents::

    [nvpy]
    sn_username = your_simplenote_email
    sn_password = your_simplenote_password

To start nvpy, just do::

    nvpy

If the pip install does not upgrade to a newer version of nvpy, try::

    sudo pip uninstall nvpy
    sudo pip install --upgrade --ignore-installed --no-deps nvpy

Integrating with your Linux desktop environment
===============================================

nvPY ships with a `.desktop file <https://github.com/cpbotha/nvpy/blob/master/nvpy/vxlabs-nvpy.desktop>`_, so that you can easily integrate it with your Linux desktop environment. This has been tested on Ubuntu Unity, but should work on KDE, Gnome3 and other environments as well.

First edit the file to check and optionally customize the Exec and Icon entries, then install it with::

    xdg-desktop-menu install vxlabs-nvpy.desktop

Advanced users
==============

You can obviously run nvpy directly from a git repo. Start with::

    git clone git://github.com/cpbotha/nvpy.git
    cd nvpy
    python nvpy
    
Don't forget to create .nvpy.cfg in your home directory before you start nvpy.
